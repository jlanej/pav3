# Run PAV3 via the pav3 CLI. This script is provided for backward compatibility
# with container workflows that reference the run script directly.
#
# All arguments are passed to "pav3 batch".
#
# Common pitfalls:
#   - This script assumes "pav3" is on PATH. If calling outside Docker, ensure
#     the pav3 package is installed (pip install .) and the virtualenv is active.
#   - The old PAV2 run script accepted raw Snakemake flags (e.g. -j 4). The
#     pav3 CLI uses --cores instead. Existing PAV2 invocations will need to be
#     updated. See "pav3 batch --help" for the current option syntax.
#   - pav3 expects "pav.json" (not "config.json") and "assemblies.tsv" (not
#     "samples.tsv") in the working directory. Verify file names before running.
